In this exercise we will play with Spark Datasets & Dataframes, some Spark SQL, and build a couple of binary classifiaction models using Spark ML (with some MLlib too). 

The set up and approach will not be too dissimilar to the standard type of approach you might do in Sklearn. Spark has matured to the stage now where for 90% of what you need to do (when analysing tabular data) should be possible with Spark dataframes, SQL, and ML libraries. This is where this exercise is mainly trying to focus.


I had to use 2 Folds only for CV because it took so much time doing CV with 5 folds. Feel free to use 5 folds. 


Here is the link for the completed project so that you can play with the code after importing it to your Databricks workspace:
