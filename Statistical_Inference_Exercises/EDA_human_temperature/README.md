# EDA_Human_Body_Temperature

In this exercise, you will analyze a dataset of human body temperatures and employ the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance.

The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37∘∘C or 98.6∘∘F for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct?

Statistical analysis of the mean body temperature based on the sample data of size 130.

# Learning Objective

- Identify variables tin the data to answer to a project question.
- Identify strong correlations between pairs of independent variables or between an
independent and a dependent variable.
- Practice identifying the most appropriate tests to use to analyse relationships between
variables.
